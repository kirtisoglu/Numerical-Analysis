# Numerical Analysis

This repository contains solution sets to the homework assignments in MATH 578, which is a grad-level numerical analysis course offered by Xiaofan Li in Spring 2025 at the Illinois Institute of Technology.

The assignments include theoretical (mathematical proof) and coding questions. Each homework (HW) folder consists of:

- A PDF of questions
- A dataset (if needed)
- A solution PDF of theoretical questions
- Matlab code files for coding questions. 

## Topics

- Approximating Functions
- Numerical Integration
- Single-step methods for Ordinary Differential Equations
- Multistep methods for Ordinary Differential Equations
- Runge-Kutta methods
- Stability and stiff equations
- Boundary value problems
- Solving eigenvalue problems
